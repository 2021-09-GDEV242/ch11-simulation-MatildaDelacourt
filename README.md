# Ch10 - Simulation

## In this simulation we have a field full of rabbits, foxes and the animal
### In this simulation i added an animal which is snakes, they age, feed from the rabbits and breed. Eventually it seems like they keep on making the rabbits die.
### therefore making the foxes die because they do not have anything to feed off of.

## They are wondering around and doing what these wonderful animals do, like being born, feeding, breeding and eventually dying.
